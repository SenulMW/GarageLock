# GarageLock
Using both hardware and software, I created my own garage door lock controlled by the  arduino chip. I used tinkercad to model my project before building the components in real life.  I incooperated an LCD display, a servo motor, LEDs, a potentiometer, and a 4x4 keypad.

## Features
- 4x4 Keypad that includes password to open lock
- Servo motor which turns when the password is entered correctly
- LED is lit up when password is entered correctly
- LCD display is used to show the numbers entered and if the password is correct or incorrect
- Potentiometer is used to ensure that the LCD display is visible\
